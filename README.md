### 🍎 iOS Developer Needed

We're looking for a developer to help wire the iOS module to the main app. All the groundwork is done — the iOS module exists and the core components are ready — but the final integration work remains. @kazemcodes is unable to continue this work due to not having access to a Mac.

The app can also leverage IReader's existing sources since they are compiled to Native/JS, making the integration straightforward.

If you have iOS/macOS development experience and want to help bring IReader to iOS, please reach out!
