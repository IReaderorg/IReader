# Installing Extensions

Extensions in IReader allow you to access books and documents from different sources. This guide explains how to find, install, and manage extensions.

## Finding Extensions

1. Open IReader
2. Navigate to the **Browse** tab or **Sources** section
3. Tap on the **Extensions** button
4. Browse the available extensions by category or use the search function

## Installing Extensions

IReader offers two methods for installing extensions:

### Method 1: Using Android Package Manager (Recommended)

This is the standard way to install extensions:

1. Find the extension you want to install
2. Tap the **Install** button next to the extension
3. If a security warning appears stating "Extension is not secure":
   - Tap **Install Anyway** to proceed
   - This warning appears because extensions are not signed with the Google Play Store certificate but are safe to use with IReader

### Method 2: Using Local Installer

If you have downloaded an extension file (.apk) from a trusted source:

1. Navigate to **Settings > General > Installer Mode**
2. Tap **LocalInstaller**
3. Navigate to the **Browse** tab or **Sources** section
4. Tap on the **Extensions** button
5. Tap the **Install** button next to the extension

## Troubleshooting Installation Issues

### Extension Not Installing

If an extension won't install, try these steps:

1. **Check Android Version Compatibility**:
   - Some extensions require specific Android versions
   - Check the extension details for compatibility information

2. **Enable Unknown Sources**:
   - Go to **Android Settings > Security**
   - Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" or "Install Unknown Apps"
   - On Android 8+, you may need to enable this setting specifically for IReader

3. **Clear Package Installer Cache**:
   - Go to **Android Settings > Apps > Package Installer**
   - Clear cache and data
   - Try installing again

4. **Restart Your Device**:
   - Sometimes a simple restart can resolve installation issues
