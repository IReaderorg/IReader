# 📚 Glossary Feature Guide

Welcome to the **Glossary Feature**! This tool empowers you to customize your reading experience by defining your own translation rules. Say goodbye to incorrect character names or confusing terms!

## 🧐 What is the Glossary?

The Glossary allows you to create a list of **Terms** and their **Translations**. When you use the translator, the app will look at your glossary and automatically replace the original terms with your preferred translations.

**Perfect for:**
*   Fixing character names (e.g., "Ye Fan" instead of "Leaf Fan")
*   Standardizing cultivation ranks
*   Correcting recurring translation errors

## 💡 Pro Tips

*   **Case Sensitivity**: The glossary is generally case-insensitive for search, but try to match the capitalization of the source text for best results during translation.
*   **Specific vs. General**: Add specific full names (e.g., "Tang San") before general terms (e.g., "Tang") if you have both, to ensure the full name is translated correctly first.
*   **Backup**: Regularly export your glossary if you have added many custom terms.
