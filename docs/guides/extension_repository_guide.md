# 📦 How to Add Extension Repositories

This guide will walk you through adding extension repositories to IReader so you can access hundreds of novel sources.

## What is an Extension Repository?

An extension repository is a collection of sources (plugins) that let you browse and read novels from different websites. Think of it like an app store, but for novel sources!

## Quick Setup (Recommended)

### Step 1: Enable JavaScript Plugins

1. Open **IReader**
2. Go to **Settings** → **General**
3. Find **"Enable Javascript Plugin"** and turn it **ON**

4. Paste this URL:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IReaderorg/IReader-extensions/master/index.min.json
   ```
5. Tap **Save**

### Step 3: Add LNReader Repository (Optional but Recommended)

1. Go to **Settings** → **Repository**
2. Tap the **+ (Add)** button
3. Select **"Quick Add Popular Repo"**
4. Choose **LNReader**
5. Tap **Save**

> 💡 Adding both gives you the best of both worlds - native performance + maximum source coverage!

### Step 4: Refresh Sources

1. Go to the **Browse** or **Sources** screen

## Adding a Custom Repository URL

If you have a specific repository URL:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Repository**
2. Tap the **+ (Add)** button
3. Select **"Add Custom Repository"**
4. Enter the repository URL
5. Tap **Save**
6. Go to Sources and refresh

### Official & Recommended Repositories

| Repository | URL | Description |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| **IReader Extensions** (Official) | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IReaderorg/IReader-extensions/master/index.min.json` | Official native IReader extensions - optimized for best performance |
| **LNReader** | Built-in (use Quick Add) | 100+ JavaScript sources, community maintained |

> 💡 **Tip:** We recommend adding **both** repositories! IReader Extensions are native and faster, while LNReader provides access to many more sources.

## Installing Extensions from a Repository

Once you've added a repository:

1. Go to **Browse** → **Sources** or **Extensions**
2. You'll see available extensions organized by language
3. Tap **Install** next to any extension you want
4. Wait for the download to complete
5. The source will now appear in your sources list!

### Tips for Choosing Extensions

- ⭐ Look for sources with recent updates
- 🌐 Filter by your preferred language
- 📚 Popular sources usually have more content
- ✅ Only install what you need to keep things fast

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No sources found" after adding repository

1. Make sure **JavaScript Plugins** is enabled in Settings → General
2. Check your internet connection
3. Try refreshing the sources list
4. Restart the app and try again

### Repository won't add

1. Double-check the URL is correct
2. Make sure you have internet access
3. The repository server might be temporarily down - try again later

### Extensions not showing up

1. Check the language filter - you might have filtered them out
2. Go to Sources and tap the filter icon
3. Select **All Languages** or your preferred language

### "Untrusted extension" warning

This is normal for new extensions. IReader warns you before running code from external sources.

1. Only install from trusted repositories (like LNReader)
2. You can manage trusted extensions in **Settings** → **Extensions** → **Trust Management**

---

## Storage Options

By default, extensions are saved to the app's cache (no permissions needed).

### To save extensions to external storage:

1. Go to **Settings** → **General**
2. Disable **"Saved Sources to Cache"**
3. Grant storage permissions when prompted

This makes it easier to backup and manage your extensions manually.
