{
  "title": "The Wandering Inn",
  "author": "pirateaba",
  "description": "An inn is a place to rest, a place to talk and share stories, or a place to find adventures, a starting ground for quests and legends. In this world, at least. To Erin Solstice, an inn seems like a medieval relic from the past. But here she is, running from Goblins and trying to survive in a world full of monsters and magic. She'd be more excited about all of this if everything wasn't trying to kill her.",
  "genre": ["Fantasy", "Adventure", "Slice of Life", "Comedy"],
  "status": "Ongoing"
}

Example details.json for "Mother of Learning":
{
  "title": "Mother of Learning",

  "description": "Zorian is a teenage mage of humble birth and slightly above-average skill, attending his third year of education at Cyoria's magical academy. He is a driven and irritable young man, consumed by a desire to ensure his own future and free himself of the influence of his family, whom he resents for favoring his brothers over him. Consequently, he has no time for pointless distractions or paying attention to other people's problems.",
  "genre": ["Fantasy", "Time Loop", "Magic", "Adventure"],
  "status": "Completed"
}
