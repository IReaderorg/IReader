## 🛠️ Video to GIF Conversion Tips

### Recommended Tools
- **FFmpeg** (command line, best quality)
- **ezgif.com** (online, easy)
- **Gifski** (Mac, excellent quality)
- **ScreenToGif** (Windows, with editor)

### FFmpeg Commands

**Basic conversion:**
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "fps=15,scale=256:-1:flags=lanczos" -c:v gif output.gif
```

**High quality with palette:**
```bash
# Generate palette
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "fps=15,scale=256:-1:flags=lanczos,palettegen" palette.png

# Use palette for better colors
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i palette.png -lavfi "fps=15,scale=256:-1:flags=lanczos[x];[x][1:v]paletteuse" output.gif
```

**Optimized for web (smaller file):**
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "fps=12,scale=200:-1:flags=lanczos,split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen[p];[s1][p]paletteuse" -loop 0 output.gif
```

### Size Optimization Targets
| Animation | Target Size | FPS | Resolution |
|-----------|-------------|-----|------------|
| Idle loops | 300-500KB | 12-15 | 256x256 |
| Actions | 500-800KB | 18-24 | 256x256 |
| Celebrations | 800KB-1MB | 24 | 256x256 |

## 💡 Alternative: Lottie Animations

If GIFs are too large, consider **Lottie** format:
- Vector-based, infinitely scalable
- Tiny file sizes (10-50KB)
- Smooth on all devices
- Supports interactivity

**Workflow:**
1. Create video in Veo3
2. Trace/recreate in After Effects
3. Export as Lottie JSON via Bodymovin

---

## 🎯 Consistency Tips

1. **Same character model** - Use identical prompt base for all videos
2. **Same lighting style** - Keep lighting consistent across moods
3. **Same camera distance** - Character should be same size in all GIFs
4. **Color-coded backgrounds** - Each mood has its own background color
5. **Test loop points** - Ensure seamless loops before converting
