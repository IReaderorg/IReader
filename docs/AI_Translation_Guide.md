## Tips for Using AI Translation

1. **Google Gemini API (Recommended)**:
   - Provides the best balance of quality and ease of use
   - Free tier includes generous quota
   - Will automatically try different models if one exceeds quota

2. **For Desktop Users**:
   - Make sure Java is properly installed for desktop version
   - If you encounter "resource not found" errors, try reinstalling the app
   - Use the standalone version with packaged JRE for best compatibility

3. **For Mobile Users**:
   - WebView options work best on newer devices
   - If you encounter CAPTCHA, you'll need to complete it manually
   - API-based options (Gemini, DeepSeek API) are more reliable on mobile

4. **Handling Quota Limits**:
   - If you see "quota exceeded" messages, try waiting a day or switching engines
   - For frequent use, consider upgrading to a paid API tier

## Troubleshooting

- **Translation Fails**: Check your internet connection and API key validity
- **Slow Translation**: Large texts are translated in batches; be patient
- **WebView Issues**: Try clearing cookies and logging in again
- **Empty Responses**: Try switching to a different AI model or engine
