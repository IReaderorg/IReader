Chapter 3: The Organization

As Alex explored the Local Library further, the importance of organization became clear. The folder structure was simple but powerful:

local/
├── Novel Series 1/
│   ├── cover.jpg
│   ├── details.json
│   ├── Chapter 001.txt
│   └── Chapter 002.txt
└── Novel Series 2/
    └── ...

Each series had its own folder. Each chapter was its own file. Clean, simple, effective.

"I should organize my collection better," Alex thought, already planning how to structure the library. "Maybe group by genre? Or by author? The possibilities are endless."

The key was the naming convention. Files sorted alphabetically, so using leading zeros was important:
- 001, 002, 003... not 1, 2, 3...
- Otherwise, Chapter 10 would appear before Chapter 2!

Alex made a mental note: "Always use leading zeros. Always."

The Local Library wasn't just a feature - it was a philosophy. Keep things local, keep things organized, keep things simple. In a world of cloud services and streaming, sometimes the best solution was the one right in front of you.
