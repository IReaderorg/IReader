Chapter 2: The Discovery

Alex scrolled through the chapter, marveling at how smoothly everything worked. The text flowed naturally, paragraph by paragraph, just as it should.

"The Local Source really does work," Alex thought, excitement building. "No lag, no loading screens, just pure reading."

The beauty of the Local Library wasn't just in its simplicity, but in its flexibility. Want to add a new chapter? Just drop a file in the folder. Want to update the cover? Replace cover.jpg. Want to change the description? Edit details.json.

It was that simple.

Alex navigated back to the novel list and saw "The Adventures of Test Novel" sitting there with its custom cover and metadata. The title, author, description, genres - everything was displayed perfectly.

"This is exactly what I needed," Alex said. "A way to read my own collection without relying on online sources."

The Local Library had opened up new possibilities. Personal notes, fan fiction, web novels downloaded for offline reading, even original works - all could live here, organized and accessible.

Alex tapped on Chapter 3, eager to continue the journey.
