COVER IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS
========================

Since I cannot create actual image files, you'll need to add your own cover image.

Option 1: Use a placeholder image
----------------------------------
1. Go to https://placeholder.com or https://via.placeholder.com
2. Generate a 300x450 image with text "Test Novel"
3. Save it as "cover.jpg"
4. Place it in this folder

Option 2: Use an existing image
--------------------------------
1. Find any JPG or PNG image you like
2. Rename it to "cover.jpg" or "cover.png"
3. Place it in this folder

Option 3: Create your own
--------------------------
1. Use any image editor (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Create a 300x450 pixel image
3. Add text: "The Adventures of Test Novel"
4. Save as "cover.jpg"
5. Place it in this folder

Option 4: Skip the cover
-------------------------
The novel will work fine without a cover image.
The app will use a default placeholder.

Recommended dimensions: 300x450 pixels (2:3 ratio)
Supported formats: .jpg, .png
File name must be exactly: cover.jpg or cover.png (lowercase)
