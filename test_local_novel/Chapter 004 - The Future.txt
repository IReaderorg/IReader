Chapter 4: The Future

Alex leaned back, satisfied with the test. The Local Library feature was working perfectly. Every chapter loaded instantly, the metadata displayed correctly, and the reading experience was smooth.

"What's next?" Alex wondered, thinking about future possibilities.

More file formats? PDF support would be nice. MOBI and AZW3 for Kindle books. Maybe even CBZ for comics?

Better metadata? Auto-extraction from EPUB files. Bulk editing tools. Series tracking.

Advanced features? Search within local novels. Bookmarks and highlights. Reading statistics.

But for now, the basics were solid. The foundation was there. The Local Library was real, functional, and ready to use.

Alex closed the app and looked at the folder on the device. There it was - the "local" folder, containing "The Adventures of Test Novel" with all its chapters, metadata, and cover.

"This is just the beginning," Alex said with a smile. "The Local Library is here to stay."

And with that, Alex began planning the next collection to add to the library. Personal favorites, hard-to-find novels, works in progress - all would find a home in the Local Library.

The adventure had only just begun.
